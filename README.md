# TOR Phylogenetics

To understand the evolution of the TOR complex manifests in other species our goal is to 
computationally confirm the proteomic sequences of the RICTOR, RAPTOR, LST8, and SIN1 components.
We seek to answer questions such as when and where have TOR components have been gained and lost
and what contexts do these occur as well as confirm or disprove previous conclusions.
